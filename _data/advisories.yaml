#TODO: work out how to add a data dir to any repo that has documentation
# atm, repo's have a docs dir that is akin to the hugo content dir.


# Define Advisory texts
# can be used in page frontmatter, e.g.:
#       advisory: experimental

texts:
  experimental: "The functionality described on this page is marked as Experimental, and as such, may change before it becomes generally available."
  kitematic: "**Legacy desktop solution.** Kitematic is a legacy solution, bundled with [Docker Toolbox](/toolbox/overview/). We recommend updating to [Docker Desktop for Mac](/docker-for-mac/) or [Docker Desktop for Windows](/docker-for-windows/) if your system meets the requirements for one of those applications."


# URL based advisories
# any URL that begins with "/engine/" will get the "engine" advisory
# will be over-ridden by the `advisory` frontmatter in the topic
# [paths]
# "/engine/" = "engine"
# "/swarm/" = "swarm"
